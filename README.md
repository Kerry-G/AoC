# Advent of Code 

## Motive

I always wanted to learn more language (especially Go), but the idea of starting a project with a language I barely know is always dreading to me.

I figured I just should start doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) with new language, with the personal objective to do it every year (with maybe a different language every year?).

This README will be used as a personal dairy over the year. 

## 2023

2023 is my first year of doing it. I started doing it in January 2024, so a bit late. I am currently at the end of Day 3 and so far, it is very interesting. I hope the next challenges are less about parsing though. 

I am also using neovim as my editor for this project, which makes it a bit more involved than my usual IntelliJ tools.
