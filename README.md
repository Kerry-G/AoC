# Advent of Code 

## Motive

I always wanted to learn more language (especially Go), but the idea of starting a project with a language I barely know is always dreading to me.

I figured I just should start doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) with new language, with the personal objective to do it every year (with maybe a different language every year?).

This README will be used as a personal dairy over the year. 

## 2023

2023 is my first year of doing it. I started doing it in January 2024, so a bit late. I am currently at the end of Day 3 and so far, it is very interesting. I hope the next challenges are less about parsing though. 

I am also using neovim as my editor for this project, which makes it a bit more involved than my usual IntelliJ tools. 

## 2025 

Re-reading my README made me realize I never wrote any intention for 2024. As Go & Neovim are still two subject I want to learn on and about, I will still be using them. However, even though it is not necessary, I will try to use coroutines more regularly and learn about the new features of 2025 Go.
